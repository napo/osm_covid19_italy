# Data analysis for the research "OpenStreetMap Contribution to Local Data Ecosystems in COVID-19 Times: Experiences and Reflections from the Italian Case"

The repository contains information and code used for the analyses supporting the article "OpenStreetMap Contribution to Local Data Ecosystems in COVID-19 Times: Experiences and Reflections from the Italian Case", to be submitted to the Journal "[Data](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/data)" for inclusion in the special issue "[A European Approach to the Establishment of Data Spaces](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/data/special_issues/EU_DataSpaces)".

The main content is the Jupyter notebook [osm_covid19_italy_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/napo/osm_covid19_italy/blob/main/osm_covid19_italy_analysis.ipynb) containing the data analysis used to extraxt information from OpenStreetMap and calculate the numbers used in the text, tables and figures of the article.

The Jupyter notebook can be executed locally installing Jupyter notebook or JupyterLab (see [https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/) for more details) or on the web using Binder:

### Intervention by the Italian community in the first outbreak cities
The cities under investigation are [Codogno](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/45.1667/9.6793)(Lodi) and [Vo'](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/45.3305/11.6422)(Padua)<br/>
The analysis focuses on building data collection and takes into consideration the weeks from from 23 February to 7 March 2020.

### Data entry regarding pharmacies in Italy 
The Italian community has undertaken to update and correct the data with the positions of pharmacies in Italy starting from the [open data dataset of the italian Mnistry of health](https://www.dati.salute.gov.it/dati/dettaglioDataset.jsp?menu=dati&idPag=5)

### Insertion of delivery service keys created during the lockdown
During the lockdown period, many commercial activities activated delivery services and, from here, the international community took action by [bringing this data](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/COVID-19_-_How_to_Map#Keys_delivery.2C_takeaway.2C_drive-through_services) to OpenStreetMap
